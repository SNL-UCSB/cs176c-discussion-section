3. What are peer to peer connections, and how can they work amidst NAT?
    - p2p connections are when data is sent directly between two end hosts, no server involved in data transfer. These connections can be setup using STUN
4. What STUN requests are made and who they resolve to?
    - STUN stands for Session Traversal Utilies over NAT, allows you to initiate connection with other peers by creating an entry in your NAT, so when the peer connection is initiated, the NAT will not drop the packets
